# Train Dispatch Simulator 

The current itteration of my train dispatch simulator. Here you can find a simple game I put together over the course of several months as time provides. 

# Current How to Use

Navigate the menus using the arrow keys. Currently, only the SFRTA map works with a single train you can drive using the **W** key. I will update it as time goes on.
